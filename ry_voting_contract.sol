// This contract will implement a decentralized voting platform for owners of equity in a company/contract to vote on proposals and changes to the company/contract.
// The contract will be initialized with a list of owners of equity in the company/contract.
// The contract will have a list of proposals that owners can vote on. New proposals may be added by any owner.
// The contract will have a list of votes for each proposal, with each owner being able to vote once on each proposal.
// Each owners vote will weighted by the amount of tokens they own in their wallets.
// The contract will have a function to tally the votes for each proposal and determine the outcome of the vote.

// The contract will be implemented using the OpenZeppelin ERC20Votes contract to manage the equity ownership and voting rights of the owners.

// The contract will have the following functions:
// 1. A function to add a new proposal to the list of proposals.
// 2. A function to allow an owner to vote on a proposal.
// 3. A function to tally the votes for a proposal and determine the outcome of the vote.
// 4. A list of owners and their equity ownership in the company/contract.
// 5. A list of proposals and their vote counts, and the duration of the vote.
// 6. A list of votes for each proposal, with the owner's address and the number of votes they cast.
